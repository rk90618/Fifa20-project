FIFA 20 is a football simulation game published by Electronic Arts as part of the long-running FIFA series. This is the 27th installment, released on September 27, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Notably, it's the first FIFA game to skip an Xbox 360 version, and the first since FIFA 07 to not have a PlayStation 3 version. A new feature in this edition is VOLTA Football, which shifts from the traditional 11v11 format to smaller street and futsal-style games, reminiscent of the old FIFA Street series. In VOLTA, players can customize their characters, choosing from a variety of options including gender, clothing, footwear, hats, accessories, and tattoos. Following the conclusion of "The Journey" in FIFA 19, FIFA 20 introduces a new storyline mode set in the VOLTA world, allowing players to experience a narrative-driven progression with their custom character. There's also a brief appearance by Alex Hunter, a key figure from "The Journey," alongside his agent Beatriz Villanova.

Additionally, the "players_20.csv" dataset offers insights into the Career Mode for FIFA 15 through FIFA 20, providing a chance to compare players' stats across these six versions of the game.
